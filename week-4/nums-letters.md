Release 1:

What does puts do?

puts writes onto the screen whatever is followed by it with a newline return.

What is an integer? 

A number without a decimal points. Examples: 1, 100, -7, 98

What is a float?

A number with decial points. Examples: 1.1, 99.999999, -86.78

What is the difference between float and integer division?

Interger division always returns an interger, if the right answer should contain a decimal point it will round down to return an integer number. Examples: 4/2 will return 2, 9/2 will return 4 instead of 4.5.

Float division will return a float number. Examples: 9/2 will return 4.5, 4.0/2.0 will return 2.0

How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Explaination please see above.

Section 2.5

```ruby
puts (365*24)
```

```ruby
puts (60*24*24)*(10*365)
```

Reflection:

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles them the same as using a calucator with the exception of the division of integers and floats. Please see below on line 48 for the difference than normal math. 

What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers and floats contain decimal points. Integer example: -1, 3, 9 100. Float example: 0.0. 1.9

What is the difference between integer and float division?

Interger division always returns an interger, if the right answer should contain a decimal point it will round down to return an integer number. Examples: 4/2 will return 2, 9/2 will return 4 instead of 4.5.
Float division will return a float number. Examples: 9/2 will return 4.5, 4.0/2.0 will return 2.0

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are a group of letters, symbols, spaces or numbers that are bundled together within single or double quotes. You would use them anytime you want to display printed text. 

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

A local variable is any sequence of letters and numbers that is assigned to it. It stores the content it is assigned in a compact name and can be refered to in the program. You would use a local variable when you want to reuse the content.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
Nice review to get back into the swing of programming.
