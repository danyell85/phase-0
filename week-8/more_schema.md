One to One:
![1to1](/imgs/1to1.png)

This is a 1 to 1 relationship because there is only one customer id for each customer. The id allows to have their preference only under them. 

Many to Many:

Reflection:

What is a one-to-one database?When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

A one to one database is used when a value can contain other values/descriptions that one might not always want to access. So unless it is called the database can run through the other infomation more quickly.

What is a many-to-many database?When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

A many to many database is when you need muliple instances on both sides of a relationship. 

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
It was hard coming up with ideas to created the databases. Most of it makes sense when looking at tables but creating them was a little confusing.
