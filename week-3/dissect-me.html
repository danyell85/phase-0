<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
    We used section to breakdown sections within the webpage, header for the heading of our page, nav for users to be able to 
    navigate around the webpage, article for the articles/blog we put in, an aside and a footer. 
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The elements are displayed from top to bottom, the css will adjust the elements on the page layout.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
We didnt get our snippet to work properly but the idea of them is useful.
