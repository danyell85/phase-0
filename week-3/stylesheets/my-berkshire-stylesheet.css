/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
Make sure it is setup correctly with rel text and href.
What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
Using margin-bottom to have text be closer together. It wasnt hard but tricky to set up table data and rows properly.
What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
Color, font-size, margins, borders, text-align *See Above*
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
Yes we used classes. It allows for the html to take in a broader about of elemenets unlike id that only allows one.
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
Ours. We didnt hard code in the html and followed proper indentation.
